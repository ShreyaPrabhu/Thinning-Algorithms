## Comparison of Various Thinning Algorithms

In this repository, you can find implementation of 4 thinning algorithms

1. Zhang Suen
2. Hilditch
3. Stentiford
4. Lu Wang

These algorithms were tested on Kannada handwritten characters.

The algorithms performance was measured based on following parameters - 

1. Thinning Rate
2. Reduction Rate
3. Sensitivity

Based on the observations made and results obtained, it could be concluded that
Zhang Suen algorithm provides better Thinning process for handwritten kannada characters.

Paper titled "Comparison of Various Thinning Algorithms on Handwritten Kannada Characters" was 
accepted for publishing at "National Conference on Information, Communication, Controls
and Computing (NCIC3 2018)" held at Sir M Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology on 23rd May 2018.
